## My process
  Started with a Desktop-first approach inhind sight I 
  dont think that was a good decision as it lead to me experiencing some issues which I resolved my further studying how fonts work.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid







### Continued development

I still find it a bit difficult to get the height of the card to fit inside the body ,I ended up using a fixed height for the desktop view






### Useful resources
